When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I push files from different computers or different places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you can sure when to pull and what to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is from github to git hub. Clone is from github to github and github to local. Branches is on github or local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Easy to operate on.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I want to make changes in a separate branch when I have a different idea from 
    master. Master is easier to operate on. You can try your idea in a separate branch.
